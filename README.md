# Ethan_Code
Collection of interesting things I've done. There is a variety of files here from Formula SAE simulations work, controls work, and firmware. There is also High Energy Astrophysics code related to energy spectral stacking pipelines and different types of statistical analysis, such as quantile analysis. I have some mathematical code from physics classes.
